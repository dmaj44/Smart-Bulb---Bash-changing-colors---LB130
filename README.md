# Smart-Bulb---Bash-changing-colors---LB130
Some small disclaimers: I know the code is suboptimal, just learning bash here. Besides that, the script is pretty easy to use:

  1. Get you token ID and device ID from the Kasa API. You can learn how to do it in http://itnerd.space/2017/01/22/how-to-control-your-tp-link-hs100-smartplug-from-internet/

 2. Replace the token ID and the device ID in the code, where it is market. (search for Token ID and Device ID in the code)
 
 3. Save the script in a UNIX enviroment and run the script. 
 
 4, Enjoy
